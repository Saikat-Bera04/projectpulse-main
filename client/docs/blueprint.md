# **App Name**: ProjectPulse

## Core Features:

- AI Teammate Matching: Utilize AI to suggest optimal teammate pairings based on skills, interests, and availability, considering factors like complementary expertise and project needs.
- Profile Creation: Allow users to create and manage their profiles, including basic information (Name, Email, LinkedIn URL, GitHub URL) and skills/tags (e.g., frontend developer, UI/UX designer).
- Project Workspace and Kanban: Provide a project workspace with a Kanban board layout (To Do, In Progress, Done) for task management and collaboration.
- GitHub Integration: Enable synchronization with GitHub for code management and collaboration. Users can connect/unlink their GitHub accounts and sync project tasks with GitHub issues.
- Analytics and Peer Review: Offer analytics and insights into project performance (task velocity, contribution breakdown, milestone completion) and peer review functionality with feedback forms and aggregated results.
- Activity Feed: Display a chronological feed of activities like new tasks, status updates, comments, and file uploads. It could be used as a tool to improve collaboration in existing teams.
- Landing Page: Create an informative landing page featuring key features (AI teammate matching, project workspace, analytics), clear CTAs (Login, Get Started), and a user-friendly design for new signups.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid blue (#29ABE2) to evoke trust, collaboration, and forward-thinking, while aligning with tech/startup aesthetics.
- Background color: Light, desaturated blue (#E5F6FD) to create a clean, modern backdrop without distracting from the main content.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF8C00) to draw attention to key actions (e.g., CTAs, buttons, highlights) and enhance user interaction.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, clean, readable appearance.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use a consistent set of line icons to represent key actions and content categories throughout the application.
- Maintain consistent structure across all pages with a header, main content area, and action section; use placeholder boxes for dynamic content (charts, Kanban, teammate cards).
